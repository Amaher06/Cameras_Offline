Survival horror game where you must use audio queues from the terminal to survive.

## Features
1. Ai that will move between rooms at semi randome pace(simaler to the ai in Five Nights at Freddys).
    Will use random ints to determine where the Ai goes.
2. 3d audio queues and sound effects to give an understanding where the monster is as well as give an eerie atmosphere
    Will use pysonic to be able to play effects at 3d level.
3. Custom terminal that is in pygame itself and allows you to select different options in said terminal.
    Will use pygame to replicate the python terminal on a full screen 2nd terminal.
## Challenges
1. I will need to learn how to use audio in python. Pygame includes a sound effect system but pysonic gives 3d audio so I would like to implament pysonic instead.
2. I need to resaerch on how to make an effective ai aswell as track the ai through room to be able to give the player sound queues.
3. I need to copy the python terminal and project it onto the game terminal.
## Outcomes
### Viable Outcome
My ideal outcome would for there to be multiple monsters with unique traits that will make the game more engaging. There will also be 3d audio to give more info aswell as suspense. Would also like the terminal to be very expressive like turning red when there is an error or completely freaking out when you die in the game.
### Minimal Viable Outcome
The minimum outcome I would like my game to have would be atleast one monster that will gradualy close in on your location. Sounds effects in general to tell where the monster is. And lastly a game terminal instead of using the terminal in vscode.
## Milestones
1. Make sound effect behind me using pysonic.
2. Make an ai that will swap between three rooms.
3. Make a simple terminal on pygame.
